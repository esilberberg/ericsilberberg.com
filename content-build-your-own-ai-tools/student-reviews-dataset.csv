Aeneas Libero,"Stats was the worst class ever. The teacher was so boring, I almost fell asleep every day. The homework was endless, and the tests were impossible. I have no idea why we even need to know this stuff. It's completely useless."
Quintus Dolor,"Stats wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great either. Some of the topics were interesting, but the class was mostly just memorizing formulas. The teacher was okay, but could have been more engaging. I'm glad I took it, but I don't think I'll ever use this stuff in real life."
Ipsum Maecenas,"I thought stats would be boring, but it ended up being okay. The teacher was actually pretty funny, which made the class more enjoyable. The homework was a bit much, but I learned some useful stuff. I'm not sure how much I'll use it in the future, but it wasn't a complete waste of time."
Orci Consectetur,Really fun! I loved learning about probability and data analysis. 
Tellus Faucibus,The teacher was so passionate about the subject
Nulla Adipiscing,"I liked the beginning of the stats class, but it got harder towards the end."
Fermentum Ultricies,"This stats class was a total waste of time. The textbook was so confusing, and the teacher couldn't explain anything clearly. I spent hours trying to figure out the homework, and I still didn't get it. I'm so glad this class is over."
Nibh Eget,"Stats was the most stressful class I've ever taken. The workload was insane, and the tests were so hard. I felt like I was drowning the whole time. I learned nothing and I hated every minute of it."
Lectus Arcu,"Stats was awesome! The teacher was incredibly helpful and always willing to answer questions. The class was challenging, but I felt well-prepared for the tests. I learned a lot of valuable skills that I know I'll use in college. Best class ever!"
Suspendisse Metus,"A mixed bag. Some of the concepts were really interesting, but the class was way too focused on calculations. The teacher was knowledgeable but didn't do a great job of explaining things. I passed the class, but I don't feel like I really understand the material."
