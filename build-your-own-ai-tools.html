            <p>We've all used AI-powered chatbots: simple input, relevant output. But what if you could be the AI creator, not just the consumer?</p> 
            <p>In this tutorial you'll build your own AI tools using Google's Gemini <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LLM</a>. You'll learn how to configure the Gemini API, incorporate Gemini into Python functions, and then use those functions to manipulate large datasets. This is just an introduction; by the end, you'll be equipped to tackle bigger, more complex projects.</p>
            <p>To make the most of this tutorial, its recommended that you have a basic understanding of Python. If not, take some time with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f79MRyMsjrQ&t=1s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this tutorial</a> and come back when you understand objects and functions.</p>

            <h3>1. Defining the problem</h3>
            <p>Analyzing student feedback can be difficult, especially with large classes and diverse responses: direct, exuberant, cagey, passive aggressive, ambiguous, etc. If we want to get a snapshot of students' opinions about a class, one way would be to rate their response based on sentiment. In other words, we could rate the overall positivity or negativity of each student's experience. Manually categorizing feedback by sentiment is time consuming. In this tutorial, we'll use Gemini to rate the positivity of student feedback on a scale of 1-5 and create a structured dataset. This will allow us to quickly identify trends and focus on specific areas for improvement. </p>

            <h3>2. Installing Gemini 1.5 Flash</h3>
            <p>Gemini 1.5 Flash is Google’s free, lightweight LLM that can handle 10,000+ words in a prompt. To get started we'll need to register for a Gemini API key and install the Google's Generative AI Python library.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><p>Follow the <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">directions to generate your API key.</a> Once generated, copy and save the key in a new file on your computer called: <code class="file-name">gemini-api-key.txt</code> Do not share this key.</p></li>
                <li><p>Then pip install <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/downloads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google's Generative AI Python library:</a></p></li>
            </ol> 
            <pre><code class="language-python">pip install google-generativeai</code></pre>

            <h3>3. Your first function with Gemini</h3>
            <p>With everything installed, we’re ready to take Gemini for a test drive. Our first project will be an AI tool that creates an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">anagram</a> of a person's name.</p>
            <p>Let's get our files organized. Create a new folder called <code class="file-name">my-ai-tool</code> and put the <code class="file-name">gemini-api-key.txt</code> file inside the folder. Create a new Python file in the folder and call it <code class="file-name">ai-tool.py</code> Your file structure should look like this:</p>
<pre>
    &mdash;&mdash; my-ai-tool
            &mdash; gemini-api-key.txt
            &mdash; anagram.py
</pre>
            <p>Inside the IDE of your choice, open <code class="file-name">anagram.py</code> and read your API key into memory. By printing the contents of <code class="file-name">gemini-api-key.txt</code> to the terminal, you can test that everything is in order:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">with open('gemini-api-key.txt') as f:
    genai_api_key = f.read()

print(genai_api_key)
</code></pre>
            <p>Next, remove the print function, import Google's Generative AI library, and configure the language model. In just two short lines of code, you'll establish a connection to the Gemini API and create an object called "model" that can generate text with the gemini-1.5-flash LLM:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import google.generativeai as genai

#Read Gemini API key into memory.
with open('gemini-api-key.txt') as f:
    genai_api_key = f.read()
    
#Configure API and select the Gemini 1.5 Flash language model.
genai.configure(api_key=genai_api_key)
model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash')
</code></pre>
            <p>With Gemini configured, let's create a function that'll create anagrams using Gemini. We’ll start with a simple function called <code class="file-name">create_anagram(name)</code> that takes a person's name as input. Inside the function, we'll use <code class="file-name">model.generate_content()</code> to send a prompt to Gemini, asking it to generate an anagram based on the given name. I’m using a Python feature called an <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_string_formatting.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">f-string (formatted string literals)</a> to add our function’s <code class="file-name">name</code> argument at the end of the prompt: Create one anagram with the letters in this person’s name: {name}.</p>
            <p>To retrieve the generated anagram as text, we'll use <code class="file-name">response.text</code>. If we omit the <code class="file-name">.text</code> attribute, the function will return metadata about the generated text.</p>
            <p>Let's try running the function with and without <code class="file-name">.text</code> to see the difference. What anagrams can we create for Albert Einstein?</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def create_anagram(name):
    """Create one anagram of the input name"""
    response = model.generate_content(f"Create one anagram with the letters in this person's name: {name}")
    return response

print(create_anagram("albert einstein"))

            <h3>4. Rating student reviews with Gemini</h3>
            <p>Now that we understand the basics of the Gemini API, let's build a new AI tool that analyzes student reviews for their sentiment.</p>
            <p>In the <code class="file-name">my-ai-tool</code> folder, create a new Python file called <code class="file-name">rate-sentiment.py</code>. Then download <a href="content-build-your-own-ai-tools/student-review-1.txt" download="student-review-1.txt">student-review-1.txt <i class="fa-solid fa-file-export"></i></a> and add it to the folder. Your file structure should look like this:</p> 
<pre>
    &mdash;&mdash; my-ai-tool
            &mdash; gemini-api-key.txt
            &mdash; anagram.py
            &mdash; student-review-1.txt
            &mdash; rate-sentiment.py
</pre>
                
                
            <p>Read this student review into memory and print it to the terminal as we did earlier with your API key: </p>
<pre><code class="language-python">#Read student review into memory.
with open('student-review-1.txt') as f:
    student_review = f.read()

print(student_review)
</code></pre>
            <p>When you run the above code, you should see this student review in the terminal:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">Stats class was definitely challenging, but I learned 
a lot! The teacher was helpful, and class discussions 
were interesting. However, I struggled with the
assignments. The instructions were often confusing,
and I spent way too much time trying to figure out
what was expected. I wish the assignments were more
clear-cut.
</code></pre>
            <p>On an individual basis, student reviews are nuanced and provide some meaningful feedback. But multiply this out by 50 or 100 times, and it becomes harder to understand whether students, in general, found a course useful.</p>
            <p>We can use Gemini to rate the sentiment of student reviews, which is to say quantify student reviews. A simple way to rate sentiment is with a Likert scale of 1-5, with 1 representing Very Negative and 5 representing Very Positive sentiment.</p>
            <p>Getting Gemini to rate sentiment effectively will take us into an area called prompt engineering, which is the process of crafting instructions to guide AI models towards desired outputs. Prompt engineering is an iterative process, so by refining our instructions we'll discover best practices for this process.</p>
            <p>Let's start by creating a function that will accept student feedback as a paragraph. This should look familiar from earlier:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import google.generativeai as genai

#Read Gemini API key into memory.
with open('gemini-api-key.txt') as f:
    genai_api_key = f.read()

#Read student review into memory.
with open('student-review-1.txt') as f:
    student_review = f.read()

#Configure API and select the Gemini 1.5 Flash language model.
genai.configure(api_key=genai_api_key)
model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash')

def rate_sentiment(text):
    """Rates the positivity of a text on scale of 1-5: 
    5 = Very Positive. 1 = Very Negative.
    """    
    response = model.generate_content() 
    return response.text

#Apply the function to our text file and see Gemini's response.
print(rate_sentiment(student_review))
</code></pre>
            <p>We can use this prompt: Rate the positivity of this student's review of a class on a scale of 1-5, with 1 representing Very Negative and 5 representing Very Positive. We can then use an <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_string_formatting.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">f-string</a> again like this: </p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def rate_sentiment(text):
    """Rates the positivity of a text on scale of 1-5: 
    5 = Very Positive. 1 = Very Negative.
    """    
    response = model.generate_content(f"Rate the positivity of this student's review of a class on a scale of 1-5, with 1 representing Very Negative and 5 representing Very Positive: {text}") 
    return response.text

print(rate_sentiment(student_review))
</code></pre>
            <p>Run the code and you should get a response similar to this in the terminal:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">I would rate this review a **3/5**. 

Here's why:

* **Positive:** The student acknowledges learning a lot, appreciates the professor's helpfulness, and finds the class discussions engaging.
* **Neutral:**  The student's experience with the assignments is mixed. While they struggle, the student doesn't express outright dissatisfaction with the professor or the class.
* **Negative:**  The student explicitly expresses frustration with the assignment instructions and wishes they were clearer. 

Overall, the review is balanced, highlighting both positive and negative aspects. It's not overly enthusiastic but also not overtly critical.
</code></pre>
            <p>The good news is that Gemini understands the prompt and is giving us a meaningful response. However, for our purposes, we just need the Likert score and not the full justification. This is prompt engineering, and what we learned from Gemini's justified response is that we need to refine our prompt to be more specific about what is our desired output. Also, if require just a single digit, we should apply the Python <code class="file-name">.strip()</code> method to remove any incidental white space from our output. Let's try this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def rate_sentiment(text):
    """Rates the positivity of a text on scale of 1-5: 
    5 = Very Positive. 1 = Very Negative.
    """    
    response = model.generate_content(f"Rate the positivity of this student's review of a class on a scale of 1-5, with 1 representing Very Negative and 5 representing Very Positive. Your output should be in the form of a single digit representing your positivity score: {text}") 
    # .text returns just text from Gemini and .strip() removes whitespace.
    return response.text.strip()

print(rate_sentiment(student_review))
</code></pre>
            <p>Let's recap: We’ve successfully passed our data to Gemini, had it analyze that data for sentiment positivity, and refined the format of its output through prompt engineering. Next we’ll apply our <code class="file-name">rate_sentiment()</code> function to an entire set of student feedback. </p>
        </section>
        <section class="lesson-content" id="5">
            <h3>5. Iterating over a large dataset</h3>
            <p>In this section we will learn how to apply our Gemini-infused function to analze a large dataset of student reviews.</p>
            <p>I've prepared a collection of 10 student reviews that we'll use to practice iterating over a dataset. Download <a href="content-build-your-own-ai-tools/student-reviews-dataset.csv" download="student-reviews-dataset.csv">student-reviews-dataset.csv <i class="fa-solid fa-file-export"></i></a> and add it to the <code class="file-name">my-ai-tool</code> folder. Your file structure should look like this:</p> 
<pre>
    &mdash;&mdash; my-ai-tool
            &mdash; gemini-api-key.txt
            &mdash; anagram.py
            &mdash; student-review-1.txt
            &mdash; rate-sentiment.py
            &mdash; student-reviews-dataset.csv
</pre>
            <p>To read the CSV dataset into memory and apply our <code class="file-name">rate_sentiment()</code> function to an entire set of reviews, we'll use <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pandas</a>, which is a very popular Python library for data manipulation and analysis. If you are not familiar with pandas already, it is well worth your time to become familiar with it <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/intro_tutorials/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">through this tutorial</a>. You can use pip to install pandas:
<pre><code class="language-python">pip install pandas</code></pre>
            <p>Once installed, create a dataframe from <code class="file-name">student-reviews-dataset.csv</code> and print the resulting dataframe to take a look at our data:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import google.generativeai as genai
import pandas as pd

[...]

# Read student review data into memory.
df = pd.read_csv('student-reviews-dataset.csv')
print(df)
</code></pre>
            <p>You should see that the dataframe has two columns, <code class="file-name">student_name</code> and <code class="file-name">review</code> and that there are reviews from 10 students.</p>
            <p>One powerful function in the pandas library is <code class="file-name">.apply()</code>, which will allow us to create a new column in our dataset that is the result of iterating over and manipulating the <code class="file-name">review</code> column data with our <code class="file-name">rate_sentiment()</code> function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import google.generativeai as genai
import pandas as pd

#Read Gemini API key into memory.
with open('gemini-api-key.txt') as f:
    genai_api_key = f.read()

#Configure API and select the Gemini 1.5 Flash language model.
genai.configure(api_key=genai_api_key)
model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash')

def rate_sentiment(text):
    """Rates the positivity of a text on scale of 1-5: 
    5 = Very Positive. 1 = Very Negative.
    """    
    response = model.generate_content(f"Rate the positivity of this student's review of a class on a scale of 1-5, with 1 representing Very Negative and 5 representing Very Positive. Your output should be in the form of a single digit representing your positivity score: {text}") 
    # .text returns just text from Gemini and .strip() removes whitespace.
    return response.text.strip()

# Read student review data into memory.
df = pd.read_csv('student-reviews-dataset.csv')

#Iterate over student reviews with Gemini
df['sentiment_rating'] = df['review'].apply(rate_sentiment)
</code></pre>
            <p>To do any kind of analysis of our rated reviews, we need to be sure that they are integers. To test, use pandas' <code class="file-name">.dtypes</code> attribute to see what kind of data we have in each column of our dataframe:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">output = df.dtypes
print(output)
</code></pre>
            <p>In your terminal you'll see that in fact the data we have in our <code class="file-name">sentiment_rating</code> column are not integers:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">student_name        object
review              object
sentiment_rating    object
dtype: object
</code></pre>
            <p>We can easily rectify this by using pandas to convert <code class="file-name">sentiment_rating</code> data to integers (int):</p>

<pre><code class="language-python"># Read student review data into memory.
df = pd.read_csv('student-reviews-dataset.csv')

#Iterate over student reviews with Gemini
df['sentiment_rating'] = df['review'].apply(rate_sentiment)

# Convert sentiment_rating to integers
df['sentiment_rating'] = df['sentiment_rating'].astype(int)

result = df.dtypes
print(result)
</code></pre>
            <p>Run this code again, and you'll see that <code class="file-name">sentiment_rating</code> data are now integers (int64). At this point, we can use pandas to get a statistical summary of our data using the <code class="file-name">.describe()</code> function. Here is what your full code should look like:</p> 
<pre><code class="language-python">import google.generativeai as genai
import pandas as pd

#Read Gemini API key into memory.
with open('gemini-api-key.txt') as f:
    genai_api_key = f.read()

#Configure API and select the Gemini 1.5 Flash language model.
genai.configure(api_key=genai_api_key)
model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash')

def rate_sentiment(text):
    """Rates the positivity of a text on scale of 1-5: 
    5 = Very Positive. 1 = Very Negative.
    """    
    response = model.generate_content(f"Rate the positivity of this student's review of a class on a scale of 1-5, with 1 representing Very Negative and 5 representing Very Positive. Your output should be in the form of a single digit representing your positivity score: {text}") 
    # .text returns just text from Gemini and .strip() removes whitespace.
    return response.text.strip()

# Read student review data into memory.
df = pd.read_csv('student-reviews-dataset.csv')

#Iterate over student reviews with Gemini
df['sentiment_rating'] = df['review'].apply(rate_sentiment)

# Convert sentiment_rating to integer
df['sentiment_rating'] = df['sentiment_rating'].astype(int)

# Use .dtypes to get a summary of data types
result = df.dtypes
print(result)

# Use describe() to get summary statistics of sentiment_rating
summary_statistics = df['sentiment_rating'].describe()
print(summary_statistics)
</code></pre>

            <p>When you run this code, you'll have some useful information for assessing students' sentiments about a class. For example, the average (mean) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quartiles</a>. You'll also get the highest rating (max) and lowest rating (min):</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">count    10.000000
mean      2.800000
std       1.549193
min       1.000000
25%       1.250000
50%       3.000000
75%       3.750000
max       5.000000

            <h3>6. Ethics of AI and Student Feedback</h3>
            <p>As <a href="https://www.chalkbeat.org/newyork/2024/01/02/schools-to-use-artificial-intelligence-to-help-coach-teachers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chalkbeat reported in early 2024</a>, some schools are already exploring how artificial intelligence can transform the way teachers receive feedback on their classroom instruction. The Urban Assembly school network invested half a million dollars in a tool that evaluates sentiment in teacher instruction, similar to the process demonstrated in this tutorial, and provides feedback based on that sentiment analysis.</p>
            <p>In our tutorial, sentiment analysis was used to better understand student feedback and make personal adjustments to teaching methods and not make personnel or grading decisions.</p>
            <p>The rollout at Urban Assembly schools raises ethical concerns about the use of AI in employee performance reviews. According to <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/04/the-legal-and-ethical-implications-of-using-ai-in-hiring" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Harvard Business Review</a>, a major concern is the lack of transparency regarding the data the AI uses for sentiment analysis. This uncertainty makes it difficult to assess potential biases, particularly those related to language nuances such as accent, regional dialects, non-verbal communication, and subtle forms of human interaction like humor.</p>
            <p>However, a <a href="https://blog.kelley.iu.edu/2024/02/21/job-performance-evaluations-hidden-effects-from-ai-in-an-evaluator-role/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">study by professors at the Indiana University Kelley School of Business</a> found that employees generally believe AI to be less biased than humans in performance reviews.</p>
            <p>Based on these articles and your experience in this tutorial, what do you think are some best practices to balance the efficiency of AI with the potential consequences of its use in performance reviews?</p>
